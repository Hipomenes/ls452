The course explores the textual production that emerged in the context of Iberian expansion to the Americas, emphasizing the tension between hegemonic imperial discourse (*raz√≥n imperial*) and actual personal experiences and the myriad counter-discourses they elicited. If the conquistador was the agent of empire, the reality of the land often turned him into a castaway, lost in land or sea. The course maps colonial literary discourse onto the vast, often hallucinatory, geography of the Americas.
